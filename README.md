# Crop-prediction-
In this project, we employ machine learning and statistical models to train and predict outcomes such as predicting crop yield based on climate variables, classifying the best adaptation strategy for each region, and estimating the economic impact of climate variability  on agricultural practices based on the cleaned dataset.
